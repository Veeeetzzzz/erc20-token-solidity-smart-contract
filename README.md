# ERC20 Smart Contract Templates
Make your own token on the Ethereum network with these boilerplate smart contracts. Create a supply of tokens for anything you want, choose the right boilerplate for you or use a combination of code to make it bespoke.
# Pre-requisites
- Metamask
- Remix IDE - use https://remix.ethereum.org/ if you want to use Metamask otherwise use your own EVM enviroment.
# Deployment to testnet (aka test) and mainnet (aka production)
After changing the contract (.sol) files to your liking, open the file in Remix IDE. Compile the file.



One compiled - your ready to deploy, you can either connect to Metamask (injected provider) or launch on one of the testnets built into Remix.



If there were no issues - your token will be delpoyed to the Metamask or selected enviroment and the address you specified.



# Credits
90% of this was already done, so all credits to Solidity and Remix teams. I just made it easier to launch your own sh%tcoin. Don't rug innocent users (sandwhiching malicious bots is fine) - I can't stop you but don't quote me as the creator. I'm just a guy who does this for fun.
